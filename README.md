# DeDuplify

## Overview
DeDuplify is a Python-based project that utilizes linked lists and hashing to efficiently remove duplicate data copies from a storage device. The combination of linked lists and hashing ensures that only one unique instance of data remains, providing a reliable solution for data deduplication. This project focuses on guaranteeing that the single instance is indeed the only file, using hash-based checks to eliminate duplication. Additionally, DeDuplify aims to minimize the use of resources involved in storing and managing data.

## Features
### 1. Data Deduplication
DeDuplify specializes in removing duplicate data copies, ensuring that only a single instance of each unique data set is retained. This contributes to efficient storage and management of data.

### 2. Linked List and Hashing
The project leverages linked lists and hashing to achieve optimal performance in identifying and eliminating duplicate data. Linked lists provide a dynamic and efficient structure, while hashing enables quick data lookups for duplication checks.

### 3. Data Integrity Verification
DeDuplify employs hashing to verify the integrity of the single data instance, ensuring that it is the authentic and unaltered version of the file. This adds an extra layer of confidence in the deduplication process.

### 4. Resource Optimization
The project is designed to minimize the use of resources involved in storing and managing data. This includes efficient memory usage and streamlined data structures to enhance overall performance.
